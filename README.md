# Report 1 Summary

This report aims to help the United Kingdom Department of Police with their stop and search policy for every police station through data science. 
Our analysis will help to identify and quantify some of the accusations the Department has been subject to, namely issues of discrimination against minority groups in performing searches without probable cause and asking suspects to remove articles of clothing for search.

After analysing the collected data, in addition to evaluating the credibility of current claims and helping to defend the Departmentâ€™s public image, we will also provide some recommendations for the Department to improve their performance on some of the 42 stations available. 
These studies will allow the development of a platform that can be used by each Officer to validate a stop and search request through an API. 
This approach will allow the Department to monitor a greater number of occurrences in real time and quickly be able to react to new situations that may occur.
